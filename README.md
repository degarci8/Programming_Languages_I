# Programming_Languages_I

This is a repository I created for my Programming Languages I class. Programming Language: C#

In this class, I went over many basic concepts such as variables, functions, loops, etc... 
As a beginner-level course, I was able to grasp the fundamentals of programming and gain an understanding of how programmers think when writing code. \
Inside this repository, you will find examples of my work throughout the class.
